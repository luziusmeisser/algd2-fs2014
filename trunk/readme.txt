Instructions for students

1. There will be a package for each lesson, eg. ch.fhnw.algd2.lesson7
2. Within that package, you will find a subpackage data that contains lecture material.
3. Within the lesson package, you will also find a subpackage exercise.
4. To solve the exercise, follow the instructions you find in the comments.
5. Create a package ch.fhnw.algd2.YOURNAME to store your solutions in. Make sure to not Umlauts or other special characters.
6. Once your solution works, commit it to SVN and add your solution to the test class.
7. Every Sunday, I will run the test and take note whose students have submitted a correct solution.

Your submitted exercises will be graded according to the following system:
- Not submitting anyhing yields 0 points.
- Submitting a wrong solution gives you 1 point.
- Submitting a solution that passes the tests gives you 2 points.
- Every week, I will randomly pick a student to explain his solution, giving you additional points or subtractions if you can't.

The points you achieve with the exercises will be used to calculate your Erfahrungsnote (or part of your Erfahrungsnote if there is a Zwischenpruefung).

It is ok to work in groups, but if you do so, please indicate this in your file headers like in the following example:
// Created by Luzius on Feb 15, 2014
// Group work with Luzius, Gunther and Nicole
Also, each of you must submit a copy of the solution separately into his own package.

It is not allowed to simply copy the solutions of others. If you can't explain your submitted solutions, you are in trouble. :)
