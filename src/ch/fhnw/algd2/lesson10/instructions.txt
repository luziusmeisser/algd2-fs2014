Part 1:
Get familiar with the concept of minimal spanning trees (minimale Spannbaeume).
Understand the algorithm of Kruskal (http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmus_von_Kruskal).

Part 2:
Create an implementation of IStrategy that wins against 4 random bots at least 30% of the time
(i.e. score 15 wins out of 50 rounds in the test).
Your strategy must have a constructor without arguments.
